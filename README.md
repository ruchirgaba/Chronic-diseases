# Chronic-diseases
Problem Statement: Develop a Machine learning Model capable of analyzing patient health records to predict and detect early signs of chronic diseases. such as diabetes or cardiovascular conditions, allowing for timely intervention and improved patient outcome.

Our exploratory data analysis highlighted significant differences in the distribution of various disease cases, illustrating the impact of various health and lifestyle factors on disease risk. We also encountered missing data in several features, emphasizing the necessity for effective missing data imputation methods 🕵️‍♀️ in healthcare prediction tasks.

We plan to leverage the power of machine learning, specifically gradient boosting algorithms like XGBOOST 🚀, to predict disease prognosis. The model will be rigorously trained and validated using a train-test split strategy 🔄, with the aim of delivering remarkable results on several performance metrics.

The disease predictions produced by the model will be evaluated using a confusion matrix, ROC curve, and Precision-Recall curve, providing a comprehensive view of the model's performance 📈. This approach highlights the importance of utilizing multiple evaluation metrics in imbalanced classification tasks ⏳.

This project underscores the potential of machine learning 🧠 in healthcare prediction tasks, providing insights that could aid in patient risk assessment 🗂️, healthcare planning 📝, and strategy formulation in clinical settings 💼. Future work could focus on refining the prediction model 🔍, exploring different strategies for class balancing 🧩, and integrating additional patient data 🔄 to enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of disease prognosis predictions 📈.
